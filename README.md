🧠 Mental Health Checkup Web Application
📌 Project Description

The Mental Health Checkup Web Application is a simple web-based system developed using Python and Flask that allows users to evaluate their mental health condition through a short questionnaire.

The application asks users a set of mental health related questions such as stress level, sleep issues, anxiety, and social withdrawal. Based on the responses, the system calculates a score and provides feedback indicating whether the user is mentally healthy, mildly stressed, or highly stressed.

This application is designed to create awareness about mental well-being and encourage users to seek professional help if necessary.
